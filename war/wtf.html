    <p id="ppp"> Developers often asked what's the best way to go 
    about building custom widgets. There are of course a number of best
     practices to consider when answering this question. In this post I'll 
     highlight a few I like to start off with. 
     Prefer composition to inheritance. Unnecessarily 
     exposing implementation details is generally a bad 
     idea, and it's no different when you are building custom
      widgets. In GWT terms, this means that your custom widgets 
      should typically extend Composite.
    </p>
    <p>Here the HorizontalPanel implementation is exposed

    Others may come to depend <img src="wazniak/914d162e749b2152ebb203fe5811fe29.png">
    on the presence of one or more inherited methods</p>
    <a href="#aa">aaaaaaa</a>
    <br />
    <div style="width: 400px;"  id="div1"> he use of HorizontalPanel is a hidden implementation detail
 We are free to change the implementation without affecting others public
       <p  id="p_in_div"> Extending Composite also ensures that you do not inadvertently 
       expose methods inherited from the parent classes into your new widget's API. Doing so 
       can quickly lead to other classes depending on not only your class' implementation, but 
       also the implementation of any parent classes. Remember, you can always add to your API. 
       It's generally impossible to take anything away without introducing a breaking change. 
    </p>
    Be wary of multiple constructors as they can quickly get out of hand
